So I'm going to try keeping a developer blog where I share various things I've learned lately. Perhaps it will also include tutorials or other useful things. Let's try some things out!

##Swanky sub-header (I hope?)

Hopefully this is displaying correctly. Let's try a code block:

``` javascript Some useless function

	var someFunc = function (a, b) {
		var total = a + b;
		return "Nothing of use";
	};

```

How about something that's actually useful? Here is a test with including Github gists:

{% gist 3778220 %}

This is a fuzzy search algorithm I've been playing around with for use in a type-ahead style search dropdown plugin. More on that later.

I'm looking forward to playing around with this blog in the future, and hopefully next time I'll have something of real interest to write about!
