I’ve been meaning to update my site for a while, and I figured until I have things figured out I would just keep a simple blog. Seeing as I’ve been trying out Octopress, I figured why not migrate it over here. I’m not sure how long I’ll keep this here, as it really depends on if/when I redo my site. Perhaps it would make the most sense keep this is simply a blog.

I was hoping my next post would be more interesting than this, but I just wanted to put something up here quickly so that the top post wasn’t “Testing Octopress/Heroku”. I have a few cool things I’ve worked on recently that I’d like to share, so hopefully I’ll get around to posting that sometime this weekend.
